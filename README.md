# Fancy Forms: Validated Edition
## Homework for March 16, 2016 (Unit 1)

The old Fancy Forms project was resurrected to add form validation.

jQuery is used to get form input, and JS is used to perform validation.

The script ensures that all fields are filled out;
that all passwords are at least 8 characters in length;
and that all passwords have at least one uppercase character and at least one number.
